- Ensure your test is well-structured and maintainable.

## Submission

Please submit the following:

1. The source code for your automated test.
2. A brief explanation of your approach and any assumptions made.
3. Instructions on how to run your test.

## How to Submit

1. Create a new repository for your submission on Github, Bitbucket, or similar service.
